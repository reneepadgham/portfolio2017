            <p><strong>The Dashboard:</strong> Project managers are often handling many projects, with multiple pieces, and teams in different time zones. Their main window into the state of all of them is the central dashboard page. The original dashboard was a listing of nothing but project names, requiring project managers to click into and scroll through each and every one to find out what was happening. </p>
            <p><strong>The Description Page:</strong> Developers need to easily locate pertinent information to the project - such as files, feature specs, and contact info. This was originally kept within a never-ending scroll page making it hard to locate key items as needed.</p>

            <p>I worked with the CTO to discover the biggest pain points and what the product needed to be able to do going forward. I was also able to collect information from project managers and developers on the platform. For the dashboard, our key findings were that users needed to instantly be aware of project state (timeliness) and customer satisfaction.</p>

            <p>After testing a few potential layouts - I created a visual interface using a progress bar for timeliness and an emoticon face for customer satisfaction. They have potential states of good (green), be careful (orange), and this is going south quickly (red) to notify users when action is necessary.</p>

            <p>I modularized the description page, locking key info to the top for easy access.</p>
            <p>This layout was intentionally kept simple. The company was evolving rapidly and we wanted to be able to effortless change the contents of this page.</p>

            <p>These pages were designed and implemented within a few weeks. The focus was on simplifying the experience and a high level of visual polish was considered unimportant.</p>
            <p>While this design was an improvement upon the existing design, some flaws became apparent with time. As Gigster scales, the timeline for a project to be completely handed off/deactivated can be much longer than the actual end date. Because of this, an individual user's dashboard can be filled with more projects than the max project estimate in the original designs - reducing the intended simplicity.</p>
