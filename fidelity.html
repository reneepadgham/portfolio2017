            <p>Xtrac is used within Fidelity to track Work Items (WI) – which are things like new account openings, account maintenance (check reorder), and account servicing (address change) related to the various financial services Fidelity offers.</p>
            <p>The existing interface made it difficult to understand what the latest news was on Work Items, and in turn, what a user should be doing in response. It was essentially a table view of actions that had occurred alongside a timestamp and brief description of what happened.</p>
            <p>I was tasked with creating a page where users can see what's happening with a work item as well as what's been happening with all the work in their queue.</p>

            <h3>Team</h3>
            <p>This was a five person team, including myself, a PM, and a software engineer along with an internal manager and UX consultant.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="half">
            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>I led ideation, low-fidelity and high-fidelity design, and clickable prototyping.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="copy">
            <p>The client was remote, and due to corporate privacy policies, screen sharing wasn't allowed - so I worked with an internal PM and UX team to understand current use patterns and problems. In the initial ideation phase, I worked to synthesize their data and insights into actionable product features.</p>
            <p>There were many technical restraints in working with a legacy system, particularly in what interactions could and could not happen.</p>

      <section class="gray-bg">
        <div class="container">
          <p class="centered">In the initial low fidelity version, I kept a lefthand menu to match style patterns in other aspects of the product and included the ability to view activity for a specific list or queue, the ability to sort activity by most recent or by work item, and the ability to sort by activity type. I placed visual emphasis on the action taken and the work item it was taken upon, and I added in a quick reply button to enable users to quickly take an action in response.</p>
          <p class="centered"><strong>We turned this into a clickable prototype and sent it out to users to get feedback.</strong></p>

          <img data-aos="fade-right" class="image" alt="Screenshot of prototype" src="images/fidelity-color.png" />
          <div class="copy">
            <p>I then implemented that feedback as I moved towards a more high fidelity design. Some users were confused by the positioning of the filter options, so I created a different visual hierarchy to try to provide greater separation between items that dictated what the list was and the list itself. I also learned that being able to hide certain fields could greatly improve efficiency of some users, so I included a settings option. I then sent this new prototype out into the world.</p>

      <section class="gray-bg">
        <div class="container">
          <p class="centered">With this feedback and some newfound technical freedoms, I evolved the design to its final form. The ability to search and find a specific item from the feed had been unfeasible in the beginning but was now possible. Since our user interviews had indicated that it would provide high value, I included it in this version.</p>

        <div class="container with-images">
          <div class="copy">
            <p>There was an obvious need for more robust filter/search options, so I redesigned the lefthand panel.</p>
            <p>I discovered the type of action taken was most indicative of whether or not a user needed to respond, so I increased the visual prominence of the action icon. I also discovered that having the response action near the action would speed up the user’s flow.</p>

          <div class="copy">
            <p>A key piece of this redesign was the ability to quickly respond - this was done with a form that appears inline with the prior action.</p>
            <p>This had previously been done on a separate page (so the flow was table - item - item history - new action) which caused a lot of friction for users and lowered productivity.</p>
