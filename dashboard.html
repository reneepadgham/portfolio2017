          <div class="section-description">
            <p>The Event Dashboard is the most trafficked organizer facing page in the website. Because of this - over the years, many teams had put information they wanted to get in front of Organizers on the page. This had been done without evaluating user needs, and it resulted in a long, cluttered, difficult to use experience. </p>
            <p>Through research, I also discovered that many organizers were struggling to understand the tools we had available to them. We were overloading our Organizers with information, but we weren‚Äôt providing the value that they needed.</p>
            <p>We also needed to align this page to our new design system.</p>

            <p>I worked together with one other designer, a PM, an engineering manager, and several engineers.</p>

          <div class="half">
            <h3>My Role</h3>

            <p>The previous event dashboard was overloaded with information (for context, this screenshot is cropped halfway through üòâ) and didn't have clear hierarchy. It was also using our old visual system.</p>
            <p>Since the content had been added by many teams over the years - nobody was sure what information was there for user needs vs. business wants. Because of this, there were also many individuals in the company that had stake in the product and were hesitant to make any major changes.</p>

        <div class="container">
          <p class="centered">To alleviate those concerns, I kicked off the project by surveying 1,022 Event Organizers via an Ethnio pop-up on the existing dashboard to better understand user needs. I also did a product walk through with our customer success team to understand the areas they were receiving the most calls about.</p>

          <div class="copy">
            <p>Based on my research, I changed the hierarchy of the page and removed information that wasn‚Äôt adding value. I learned that tickets sold, page views, and email invite conversions were the most important so I made them easily accessible at the top of the page.</p>
            <p>I also worked with another designer to align the page content to our design system language and create new patterns for the system where necessary.</p>

            <p>I was able to combine a user need with a business need by creating a ‚Äúresources‚Äù section. This allowed users to easily find our tools that would add the most value to their event, and it gave the business an opportunity to highlight new tools and features as they were launched.</p>
            <p>Ideally, long term, this list will be determined algorithmically based on what we know about the user.</p>
